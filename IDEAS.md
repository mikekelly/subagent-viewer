- The concept of this project: create a TUI (using OpenTUI) that can be started with `bunx subagent-viewer` - it uses wherever subagents stream to for a given project to provide a real time view of subagent activitiy. It should show have a side panel on the left with a list of subagents, with live subagents at the top and completed subagents underneath. Live agents should be a real time stream visualising their activity (thinking, tool calls, streaming tool outputs, etc) and completed subagents should also show the same visualisation (although it wont be streaming as their actiity is complete). This will likely require the claude code agent investigating this by running experiments to see how subagents output their activity in order to figure out how the information can be accessed.
